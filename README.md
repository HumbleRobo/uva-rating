# UVa Rating

This project is based on the website [Uva Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org), and analyse the data from [uHunt API](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/api) made by the author [Felix Halim](https://github.com/felix-halim).

I want to make this project because this is really difficult to understand how hard the problems are, compared to [CLIST](https://clist.by/problems) the service I always use to practice my programming skills.
